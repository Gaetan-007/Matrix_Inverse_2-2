# Matrix_Inverse_2-2
This is a project in which our team uses Verilog HDL to achieve the inverse of 2-order matrix.

## Introduction
In the field of array signal processing, the adaptive array beamforming technique has an effective interference zero-trap capability with a certain range of applicability. Designing adaptive beamforming systems in digital baseband systems has the advantages of high channel accuracy and fast computation speed. However, in adaptive beamforming algorithms, such as MVDR, MMSE, MSNR and other beamforming algorithms, the inverse of the time-domain data covariance matrix needs to be calculated under narrowband conditions.

## Supplyment
The source code will coming soon when we submit our works to contest organizing committee :)
